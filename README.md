# JavaScript  - JavaScript and DOM Manipulation

## Background

 `ALIENS-R-REAL` have collected all of the eye-witness reports we could to prove it! All we need to do now is put this information online .

There is just one tiny problem though... our collection is too large to search through manually. Even our most dedicated followers are complaining that they are having trouble locating specific reports in this mess.

this is a code that will create a table dynamically based upon a [dataset provided](StarterCode/static/js/data.js). We also need to allow our users to filter the table data for specific values. This code used pure JavaScript, HTML, and CSS, and D3.js on this web pages. 


### Level 1: Automatic Table and Date Search (Required)

* Create a basic HTML web page or use the [index.html](StarterCode/index.html) file provided (we recommend building your own custom page!).

* Using the UFO dataset provided in the form of an array of JavaScript objects, write code that appends a table to your web page and then adds new rows of data for each UFO sighting.

  * Make sure you have a column for `date/time`, `city`, `state`, `country`, `shape`, and `comment` at the very least.

* Use a date form in your HTML document and write JavaScript code that will listen for events and search through the `date/time` column to find rows that match user input.

### Dataset

* [UFO Sightings Data](StarterCode/static/js/data.js)
